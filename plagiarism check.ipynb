    "`Vacuum extraction was first described in 1705 by Dr. James Yonge, an English surgeon, several decades before the invention of the obstetric forceps. However, it did not gain widespread use until the 1950s, when it was popularized in a series of studies by the Swedish obstetrician Dr. Tage Malmstr√∂m.5 By the 1970s, the vacuum extractor had almost completely replaced forceps for assisted vaginal deliveries in most northern European countries, but its popularity in many English-speaking countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, was limited. By 1992, however, the number of vacuum assisted deliveries surpassed the number of forceps deliveries in the United States, and by the year 2000 approximately 66% of operative vaginal deliveries were by vacuum`\n",
